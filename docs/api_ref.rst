API Reference
=============
The Coin Metrics API provides discovery mechanisms, network, exchange, and asset data via a direct JSON REST API. This module acts as a client interface.

The :ref:`base` and :ref:`timeseries` APIs are available to all users without an API key. The :ref:`pro` API does require an API key that is only obtainable though `CM Network Data Pro`_.
